* Male drivers constitute 58.9% of the total driver population.
* There are three education levels among drivers, all of which have nearly equal distributions within the driver community.
* The most frequent grade attained by drivers is Grade 2, with a declining count as the grade level increases.
* The majority of drivers fall between 21 and 58 years old, with 32 years being the most common age. Specifically, the peak number of drivers occurs within the age range of 31 to 41 years.
* The highest number of drivers prefer City C20 over other locations.
* Majority number of reporting of drivers prefer R6 over other number of reporting.
* July received the maximum number of drivers in 8 years.
* February and March receives the least number of Drivers joining OLA.
* Joining of Drivers receives a boost of about 500% after 2017.
* So we see that there are 57% male employees and 43% female employees.
* The percentages of employees with different education levels are almost same for level 1 & 2.
* 97.3% of the employees who did not get a raise.
* Almost 43% of the employees joined at lowest designation 1. 34% joined at level 2, 20% at level 3 and below 2% joined at higher levels.
* Only 54.6% of the employees received a promotion, while 45.4% did not. However, only 2.6% received a raise in income.
* Number of employees has been increase with increase in year as well as number of reporting.
* The number of male employees found in reporting is more than women employees.
* Scatter plot of Income shows that Income increases with increase in age but after 45-50, we see a subtle decline.
* Scatter plot of Total Business Value shows an increase with increase in Age yet we notice a decline after 45.
* Income decreases with increase in Destination as about 4% of the employees hold higher designations.
* The median of the Income for employees having higher Grades is greater.
* Distribution of Income for employees at different Education level is about a change of 3-5% with level 0.
* The ROC AUC of 0.94 signifies that the model is able to discriminate well between the positive and the negative class.
* But it is not a good measure for an imbalanced target variable because it may be high even when the classifier has a poor score on the minority class.
* This can happen when the classifier performs well on the majority class instances, which dominate the dataset. As a result, the AUC may appear high, but the model may not effectively identify the minority class instances.
* Joining Designation Increases with increase in Grade.
* Top reporting days is 24 days.
* About 55% of the reporting of the employees has got quarterly Rating 1.
* Number of reporting increases with increase in Income as well as Total Business Value.
* Recall increased after treatment of data imbalance and is performing better in Gradient Boosting.
* Precision dropped after treatment of data imbalance and is performing better in Random Forest.
* F1_score increased after the treatment of imbalanced data and in Gradient Boosting.
